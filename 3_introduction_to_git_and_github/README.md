- Version Control Systems (VCS) allows us to keep track of when and who did what changes to our files. Those can be code, configuration, images, or whatever else we need to track. It also allows multiple people to collaborate together on the same project.
- Git is used to keep a history of our code (and config) changes.

On top of search results, here are some great Git resources available online:
- [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2): This book (available online and in print) covers all the fundamentals of how Git works and how to use it. Refer to it if you want to learn more about the subjects that we cover throughout the course.
- [Git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial): This tutorial includes a very brief reference of all Git commands available. You can use it to quickly review the commands that you need to use.
