## Summary
- Version Control Systems (VCS) allows us to keep track of when and who did what changes to our files. Those can be code, configuration, images, or whatever else we need to track. It also allows multiple people to collaborate together on the same project.
- Git is used to keep a history of our code (and config) changes.
