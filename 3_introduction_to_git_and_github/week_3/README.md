## Introduction to GitHub
### Intro to Module 3: Working with Remotes

### What is GitHub?
Git - Distributed Version Control System
> Distributed: Each developer has a copy of the whole repository on their local machine. Each copy is peer (equal) of the others. We can host one of these copies on the remote server and use it as a remote repository for other copies. This lets us synchronise work between copies through the server.

Either we can create/host our own git server, or use one of the off-the-shelf solutions like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc.  

GitHub 
- Web-based Git repository hosting service. 
- On top of the version control functionality of Git, GitHub includes extra features like bug tracking, wikis, and task management. 
- GitHub lets us share and access repositories on the web and copy/clone them to our local computer, so we can work on them.
- GitHub provies free access to a Git server for public and private repositories. However, the number of contributors for free private repositories.

> For real configuration and development work, we should use a secure and private Git server, and limit the people authorized to work on it.
